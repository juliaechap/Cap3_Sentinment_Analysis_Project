# Cap3_Sentinment_Analysis_Project
Capstone 3 Project - Sentiment Analysis using Twitter API 

# I. Introduction
##. A. Goal 
This project aims to determine any reason for negative sentiment that surrounds Uber as a company. Determining the source of any negative sentiment will allow us to propose practical solutions to help boost sentiment, allowing the public to view the company in a positive light and hopefully encourage market valuation to move forward.

## B. Background 
In the recent months, Uber has become a social focus as their prices skyrocket following the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased pricing, as well as increased wait times, have left riders questioning if there is truly any convenience left when it comes to using Uberâ€™s services. These increased prices also seem to not take into account fair payouts for drivers, which was publicly voiced as Uber drivers led a strike for better pay this summer. In 2019, Uber fell short of their expected market valuation following their IPO closing and has struggled to reach that expected market valuation mark ever since. We are aiming to improve the social sentiment surrounding Uber in hopes of seeing a more positive financial outcome for the company as whole.
